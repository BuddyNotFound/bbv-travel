> **Script information** 

Simple standalone script that adds a way to go to and back from Cayo Perico with cutscenes, optimized easy to configure and translate using the config and lang files.

This script was made yesterday around 3:40 am so I decided to wait for the day to upload it, scripts similar to this one are purely a coincidence, not trying to steal anyone's work.

**As always if you like my work you can leave a :heart: and feedback in comments.**
